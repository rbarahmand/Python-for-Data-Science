# Python for Data Science

This repository was created for making nice jupyter notebooks targeting python for data science and data analysis in a friendly and well-organized manner.

## Description

This is my own journey into learning python for data analysis through my 2 year plan on learning data science. I tried my best to make these series of notebook as clear and concise as possible.

Stay tuned for my other series of notebooks! üòç.
